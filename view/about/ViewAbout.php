       			<p>I first garnered my love for computing in 1995. The Internet was one of those things that was not widely available in my area, but I showed a profound interest in it. I remember reading a book fair flyer and seeing an ad for CompuServe. It came with 4 floppy disks (and when I say floppy disks, I mean the 1.44MB ones) and a guide on how to connect to the Internet. I could not persuade my father into letting me use it, but my grandparents seemed to five in to my sales pitch. Fast forward one month, and the phone bill that came it had it immediately shut down and uninstalled from that Windows 3.1 PC (that had Leisure Suit Larry installed on it) - KEN SENT ME!</p>
       			<p>Of course, I was not willing to take this as an answer. I already connected and I was addicted. My only problem was that I needed to get a local provider. In a town with only 150 people, this was somewhat of a challege. We did eventually find an opportunity in 1996 with Carol's Book and Music Store. They had an Internet provider based out of Salina, Kansas and was interested in serving our community as a small sample. Problem was, we had to guarantee at least 50 people would use it (and that is 1/3 of the town). My best friend and I went from door to door to get people signed up. For $29.99 / month, you could surf the web at a blazing 28.8 KBPS!!! We actually managed to get the signatures and my quest for knowledge began.</p>
       			<p>Eventually the speed increased and cable modems came to be. I started being a script kiddie on the old BBS systems and a general annoyance. I created websites dedicated to almost anything! At that time, Tupac Shakur had died and I made all kinds of sites dedicated to his music. Might even be able to find some still online!</p>
       			<p>Throughout High School, I dedicated every waking moment to something surrounding computers. From gaming to programming. My first language that I learned was Perl. This was a monumental task, as even people today do not understand it! It took my almost a year just to get basic syntax down, but I had no formal training, but dynamic sites was something that intrigued me. Eventually I graduated and started college and Fort Hays State University and after my first year I landed back in community college finishing general education.</p>
       			<p>I worked for my grandfather in the family car lot at that time (around 2002) and found myself more involved in work. My grandfather found the web to be a good resource for him to post his vehicles for advertising. An idea emerged and my first commercial application was developed. It allowed a person with no web experience to post pictures of their cars on a website and enter a brief description of what was for sale. This eventually extended to my friend Marty Mead, as he had a collection of car parts that needed to be sold. CarPartJunkies was born. Around this time, (2003) I started to take notice of a programming language named PHP.</p>

        		<p>I was then contracted by Michael Zihal to create an automated script for &quot;the longest image on the Internet&quot;. This was hosted at bluesfear.com and even got reviews in magazines and had the highest &quot;digg&quot; count for a while. This was my first commisioned work outside of state lines with remote communication. It proved to be an interesting experience, but I managed to turn the project in about 12 days - working almost 16-18 hours a day directly.</p>
       			<p>A few years later, I decided to finish my education in Computer Science. I needed to formalize my knowledge as I seen holes in some of the things in which I knew. I started back initially over the Internet through Fort Hays State University again and transferred to Oklahoma City Community College where I completed my Associate in Science in Computer Science. I then moved on to the University of Oklahoma, where I am currently on my final semester for a Bachelor in Science in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. </p>

        		<p>When I transferred to OCCC, towards the end of my tenure, I managed to land a job at Hewlett-Packard. Of course, the job was in Operations, but I was hired on the premise that professional CS experience was needed and I would be guaranteed opportunity to prove my software engineering expertise. While there, I created a series of applications that managed the billing process for the print room and mail room and also provided analytics for workflow. The scope of the project was rather large and took almost a year to complete, but thus far has proven to be very sturdy. It has held to harsh scrutiny in the audit process and has proven to be a critical piece of software in the day to day operation of the site.</p>
       			<p>As for my future, I hope to acquire a formal job in Software Engineering. I've been freelancing for years, mainly writing web services. I have considered going into business for myself, but I am timid when it comes to capital investment. Though I can be a risk taker, having a family and a wife doesn't make me want to hop off the deep end just yet. For now, until I graduate, I will seek a job, but continue the fun I am having writing software. I've had fun with some of the projects, which have allowed me to work with companies I normally would not get to work with (Texas Instruments).</p>
